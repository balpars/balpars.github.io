## TLDR
1) Press F2 to enter BIOS during boot
2) Go to Main Tab
3) Press Ctrl + S (Yep, Seriously...)
4) Disable Intel-VMD

## Motivation
I spent an entire evening wrestling with a TravelMate laptop that suddenly threw a Blue Screen of Death saying "Inaccessible Boot Device". After digging through settings, Googling like a madman, and nearly losing my sanity, I decided to write this post â€” because in my 20 years of using computers, Iâ€™ve never seen a more ridiculous design choices that made troubleshooting this painful.

## Problem
The main culprit? Intel VMD â€” a piece of tech you probably never asked for, never needed, and almost certainly disabled during Windows installation. Why?

Because when itâ€™s enabled, Windows canâ€™t see your hard drive. So, like most people, you probably Googled your way out of it and disabled it during install. Problem solved. Life goes on.

Until one dayâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t. Suddenly your laptop refuses to boot.
You vaguely recall messing with BIOS at some point. Could that be it?

## Stupidity
Hereâ€™s where it gets spicy.

I jumped into BIOSâ€¦ and surprise! I couldnâ€™t change anything. Every setting was grayed out.
Then I noticed something called Supervisor Password. Out of curiosity (and mild rage), I set a password.

Boom. Settings unlocked.

Let that sink in: I had to set a BIOS password on a laptop I donâ€™t even own, just to be allowed to change the settings.

So now I had access. I disabled Secure Boot, fiddled with some other cryptic abbreviations (not RAM or CPU, donâ€™t worry ðŸ˜…), tried booting again... still nothing.

And then it hit me. There were more settings in this BIOS, right? Googled again â€” yep, turns out there are secret options you can reveal by pressing Ctrl + S.
No hint, no UI indicator, just a good old-fashioned cheat code. Because why not?

## Solution
So I pressed Ctrl + S, the BIOS revealed its secrets, and there it was:
Intel VMD = Enabled. Again. Of course.

I disabled it. Rebooted.

Laptop came back to life like nothing ever happened. No drama. No tears.

## Conclusion
Look, this laptop is a great deal for the price. But Acer, come on...

* Donâ€™t ship consumer devices that fail to boot out-of-the-box when factory reset.
* Donâ€™t hide critical BIOS settings behind secret key combos with zero indication.
* And for the love of tech, donâ€™t make users feel like they're trying to unlock a Konami code just to access their hard drive.

I survived this nonsense so you donâ€™t have to. Hope this helps someone avoid the rage spiral.
